# R-analysis-and-report-templates

The purpose of this repository is to contain R and Rmd code to performn/present statistical analyses I use frequently.  All programs use data files contained in R packages.  The intention here is to create basic self-contained files which can be easily edited to use with real project-specific datafiles.
