# R-analysis-and-report-templates

The purpose of this repository is to contain R and Rmd code to perform/present statistical and graphical analyses I use repeatedly.  All programs use data files contained in R packages.  The intention here is to create basic, working, self-contained files which can be easily edited to use with real project-specific datafiles.    

1. Template_with_notes: Template for creating nice looking reports via R markdown, with notes and resources
2. Template_clean: Same as (1) but without the additional notes
3. Example_PS_matching: Example of propensity score matching for survival outcomes.  Uses SuperLearner to estimate propensity scores, and Matching package to find matches.
